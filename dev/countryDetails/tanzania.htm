			<p>A third of Tanzania is national park – the Serengeti plain draws hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. Formed when Tanganyika on the mainland and the island of Zanzibar joined together after gaining independence from Britain, Tanzania has been an island of peace in the troubled region of east Africa for 35 years. Currently, 1.3 million are infected with AIDS and more than a million are orphaned. Also, land degradation leads to major threats to the environment.</p>
