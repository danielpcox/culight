			<ul>
				<li>Lots of different prayer initiatives are growing all the time.</li>
				<li>The United States remains the largest sender of missionaries in the world. It also remains one of the most generous nations, in terms of charitable organizations.</li>
				<li>The impact of American evangelist Billy Graham has been incredible, as he’s preached the gospel to more people and witnessed to more leaders than any other person in history. Evangelical Christians are basically maintaining numbers, despite considerable church decline, and are becoming more prominent in mainline denominations. </li>
				<li>The nation-wide impact of newer movements such as renewal among Catholics, growth in evangelicalism, and spread of campus ministries throughout colleges and universities.</li>
			</ul>

		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping The United States in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Nominalism has been growing among U.S. Christians. Pray for renewed passion and a heart of repentance so that Christians can have revival in their spiritual walks with God.</li>
				<li>The U.S. remains a strong superpower in the world. Pray for guidance and wisdom for its leaders especially in this time of economic crisis and war.</li>
				<li>The spiritual heritage of the U.S. has slowly eroded. Pregnancy rates, suicide rates, drug abuse, and spiritual vulnerability remain prominent among American youth. Pray that young people will come to know the healing and freedom of Christ’s love and lordship.</li>
				<li>Pray for spiritual unity amongst the Body of Christ in the U.S., that the Church will come to grow passionate for prayer, discipleship and preaching of the Word to all.</li>
				<li>Pray that the Church will serve the ‘unreached’ people groups in the U.S., such as the Jewish community, South Asians, Muslims, international students and reach out to them.</li>

			<p>The inscription on the Statue of Liberty reads “Give me your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”. The dream of freedom and opportunity has drawn people from all over the world to settle in America; it now has the greatest variety of ethnic groups of any nation in history.</p>
			<p>The USA has grown to be one of the most powerful economies in the world and is home to some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, but 35 million American citizens live below the poverty line.</p>
