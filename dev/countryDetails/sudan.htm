				<li>Through the long and terrible war, Christians have had to move all over the country, which now means that there are now churches in places where people have never heard of Jesus.</li>

		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping Sudan in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Pray that the world leaders can help bring the practice of slavery to an end. The Islamic government has re-introduced slavery to Sudan. As many as 200,000 people have been kidnapped from the south and sold as slaves. </li>
				<li>Pray that Christians remain strong in their faith and that there would be justice and freedom throughout Sudan. Persecution is increasing and has been more extreme since 1985. Church services have been bombed, whole villages destroyed, and church leaders have been murdered. </li>
				<li>Ethnic and rebel fighting occurs regularly while labor and sex trafficking are rampant problems in the country.</li>

			<p>Tensions in Sudan between the Arab Muslims in the north and mainly African Christian and pagan population in the south have led to two civil wars. </p>

			<p>In 2003, a separate conflict began in the Darfur region of Western Sudan. At least 200,000 have been killed and nearly 2 million displaced; UN peacekeeping troops are still struggling to stabilize the situation.</p>
			<p>Sudan was declared an Islamic Republic in 1083 and have made attempts since then to Islamize the country- introducing shari'a law and turning schools into Muslim schools. </p>
