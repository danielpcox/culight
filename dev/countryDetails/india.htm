				<li>Through the persecution that Christians have suffered, the church has become more united.</li>
				<li>Thank God for the new found openness in the Tsunami affected areas, where Christians helped after the devastation. New churches are starting up in those areas.</li>
				<li>An amazing 100,000 Indians find out about Jesus everyday through the Jesus film.</li>

		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping India in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Pray for Christians in India who face continued persecution-that they have the strength to love and forgive the people who persecute them, and for the Indian missionaries, some who have been martyred in recent years. </li>
				<li>Pray for wisdom and integrity for the pastors of the new churches starting up, and for models of discipleship and worship that reflect their own culture in these churches. </li>
				<li>Pray for those whose lives and health are at risk everyday. There are 41 million Indians without a home. </li>
				<li>Pray that the people who search for fulfillment and truth through Hinduism will find Jesus and get to know God, their Creator. </li>
				<li>Significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and ethnic and religious strife are some of the main issues concerning the country. </li>

			<p>More than a billion people live in this country which dominates South Asia. Recently they have suffered unusual weather patterns such as the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 quake. Many people still have no homes to rebuild their lives in. 
As the spiritual home of Hinduism, 96% of the 820 million people in the world who follow Hinduism live in India. The whole of Indian society is based on Hinduism, which divides everyone into different "castes" (classes).</p>
			<p>India's economy has grown quickly in the last ten years but is also home to many of the world's poorest people. Over 600 million people in India live in deep poverty and another 300 million don't have enough to live on each day. Yet in the past ten years, poverty has been reduced by 10%. </p>
