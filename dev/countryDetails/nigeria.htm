			<ul>
				<li>The largely Muslim political dominance has ended with the election of a committed Christian believer, Obasanjo, as president.  Thank God for this opportunity for a new beginning!</li>
				<li>Praise God for the Church has been growing pretty rapidly. This has been among Anglicans, Baptists, evangelical groups such as ECWA and TEKAN with interdenominational roots (SIM, SUM/AP, etc.) and Pentecostal and charismatic denominations (both indigenous and international). Specifically, Evangelicals have grown from 2.1 million in 1960 (5.7%) to 17.2 million in 1980 (17.2%) and 26 million in 2000 (23.5%). The Full Gospel Businessmen's Fellowship, with 800 chapters, has had a significant impact on the leaders of the political and commercial world.</li>

		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping Nigeria in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>The government needs time, the support of the people and courage to bring about the painful reconstruction of the country after four decades of being plundered by its leaders. Pray for the right balance between tact and firmness and between revolution and evolution in economic affairs, vested interests and tribalism.  Pray specifically for the new president, Obasanjo.</li>
				<li>Please pray for the unity of Nigeria. The combined effects of ancient tribal hatreds, Muslim conquests, British colonial policy in which the North and South were handled differently and the bitter Biafra war of 1967-70 have left deep scars. Pray for healing and reconciliation.</li>
				<li>Please pray for the AIDS crisis. Official estimates for 1999 indicated 5% of the population (2.4m) were carrying the virus. The actual figure may be nearer 7 – 8%. There are an estimated 1.4 million AIDS orphans. Churches need to be mobilized to minister to those affected.</li>

			<p>Independent since 1960, Nigeria transitioned to a civilian government in 1999.  This government has a tough job of reforming a petroleum-based country, whose revenues have been wasted through corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy.  Nigeria is also filled with longstanding ethnic and religious tensions.</p>
