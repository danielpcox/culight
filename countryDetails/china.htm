			<ul>
				<li>Praise the Lord for the growth of the Church in China since 1977, which has no parallels in history. The 1,266,000 Protestant members in 1949 had become 17m members in 2000 as well as a much larger uncounted, but estimated, 45m house church Christians. </li>
				<li>Praise God for the faith and commitment of Christians under what may prove to be the most harsh and widespread persecution of the Church in all history. The persecution purified and indigenized the Church and has inured it to successive waves of further repression and government efforts to weaken or destroy it.</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping China in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>The 'One Child' policy is a draconian means of taming the growth of the population. Family life has been deeply impacted, shown in: a higher divorce rate, 10m abortions a year (nearly all girls), suicide (40% of the world's suicides are in China), and the abandonment of baby girls and older people. The rising generation will pay a heavy cost – in 2000 there were 90m marriageable unmarried men; in some areas young men outnumber young women by 30-40% – rape, abductions, female slavery, incest, prostitution and the rapid spread of AIDS could all be the result. Pray for family stability and health. Pray also for wise policies that will stabilize the population.</li>
				<li>All Communist Party members are officially atheist, but among them are many who are secretly religious and even Christian. Pray for the collapse of the whole atheistic system and its lies so assiduously propagated in the education system, and pray for the conversion of those within the Party.</li>

			<p>For centuries, China was the world’s leader in arts and sciences.  However, after World War II, the Communists under Mao Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978, his successor Deng Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight.</p>
