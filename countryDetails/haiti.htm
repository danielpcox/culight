				<li>Praise God that Christians around the world have quickly flocked to help those who have been impacted by the earthquakes of 2010.  Reconstruction, distribution of food and water, and the opening of free shelters have been begun quickly.</li>
				<li>Praise God that Christians have stood up against the voodooism and Satanism that grips Haiti in the name of Jesus.</li>

		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Pray for the quick distribution of clean water, food, and shelter to those who are in great need.</li>
				<li>For leaders of the Haitian government, and helping organizations to efficiently and quickly facilitate the recovery process.</li>
				<li>Pray that the 22% of the population who are born-again Christians will persevere in discipleship and teaching and training leaders in the church - as many can barely read.</li>
				<li>The rich Mulatto elite live a completely different life from the majority and do not have any contact with the evangelical churches. Pray that they will hear the gospel and open their hearts to God.</li>

			<p>Haiti is the western third of the island of Hispaniola shared with the Dominican Republic. Since 1804, after becoming the first black republic in the world after a slave revolt, Haiti has experienced a history of bloodshed and dictatorships. Elections have been corrupt even after the US intervened in 1994 in an attempt to establish a fairer government.  In 2010, Haiti experienced devastating earthquakes which killed many people. Reports state that the death toll could exceed 200,000. Many are without clean water, food, and shelter.</p>
