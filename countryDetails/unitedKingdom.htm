				<ul>
				<li>The cease fire of 1998 in Northern Ireland has been largely maintained.</li>
				<li>Evangelical Christians are basically maintaining numbers, despite considerable church decline, and are becoming more prominent in mainline denominations. Some newer movements and innovative post-modern culture churches are growing.</li>
				<li>Some ethnic minorities have been more receptive with considerable growth in African-initiated churches, multi-ethnic churches and also over 6,000 ‘Travellers’ (Roma/Gypsy) coming to Christ in the past few years.</li>
			</ul>
		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping the United Kingdom in Prayer</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Britain’s suicide and teenage pregnancy rates are among the highest in Europe.</li>
				<li>London is one of the world’s most strategic cities. Pray that Christians can bring God’s influence into all these levels of society – and change the world! </li>
				<li>Pray that Christians in the U.K. will stay strong in their faith, as there have been growing pressures from different cultures and religions to conform society to be “tolerant” of their beliefs, while labeling Christian morals as “intolerant.” Pray that they would continue to preach the “intolerant” Gospel lovingly with grace and truth.</li>

			<p>The United Kingdom is a union of countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The British Empire once covered a quarter of the globe and the British Navy “ruled the waves” Throughout the twentieth century the empire dissolved and Britain has made the uncomfortable adjustment from a world power to a reluctant European nation. Conflict in Northern Ireland, between the Irish and the British, has been brewing for hundreds of years. Thirty years of guerrilla violence have made the process of finding peace difficult.</p>
