			<p>In between the Middle East, Asia and the former Soviet Bloc, Afghanistan has been a war zone for thousands of years.</p>
			<p>For five years, the Taliban, an extremist Islamic group, controlled 90% of the country and allowed Afghanistan to become a hiding place for terrorists. The afghani links to the World Trade Center attacks have prompted the U.S. bombing campaign which has brought immeasurable suffering and hardship to a country already so damaged by war.</p>
			<p>In 2005, the new democratic government was formed and a new constitution was agreed upon. The constitution pledges to uphold the International Charter of Human Rights which advocates religious freedom. While there has been more openness in Kabul, Afghanistan has remained a strictly Islamic, closed country.</p>
