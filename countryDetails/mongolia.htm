			<p>Mongolia lies sandwiched between China and Russia. One of its most famous leaders was Genghis Khan who was around during the 13th century. During that time the Mongolian empire grew to be the biggest the world has ever known, stretching right the way across Asia as far as Central Europe. 40% of the population live a nomadic lifestyle, moving around with their houses and animals. This lifestyle means that many have been massively affected by devastating snowfalls and harsh winters in recent years. Thousands of animals have died and many people are living on the brink of starvation. Over half the population follow Buddhism or Shamanism or both. Mongolia has strong links with Tibet and most Buddhist Mongolians will try to visit Lhasa in Tibet at least once in their lifetime.</p>
