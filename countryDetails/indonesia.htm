				<li>Over 50% of Chinese Indonesians now follow Jesus. Also, many who used to believe in animism, worshipping and sacrificing to spirits, have become Christians.</li>
				<li>Though facing persecution in the 90's, Christians united together and experienced a growing passion for prayer.</li>

		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world;
                however, at least 65 million "Muslims" do not strictly follow
                the religion - pray that they would hear the gospel and accept Jesus as their Savior.</li>
				<li>Indonesian Christians are committed in spreading the gospel. Pray that God would expand their vision to see people hearing the gospel in every village on every island.</li>
				<li>Pray that churches and Christian organizations will continue to provide solutions for post-tsunami issues and the widespread poverty.</li>
				<li>The cities of Jakarta and Surabaya are key cities in reaching the rest of Indonesia. The capital of Jakarta alone has at least 1,000 churches.  Pray that the Christians in these cities would impact the rest of the country.</li>

			<p>Indonesia is a string of 17,000 islands stretching between
            Thailand and the Northern tip of Australia. Indonesia has about 170
            million Muslims and 30 million Christians. Although Christianity is
            one of the five recognized choices of religion that citizens must
            choose, Christians are highly discriminated against. Many are in
            jail and under false charges.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the economic crisis of
            Asia. As a consequence, about half the population now lives under
            sever poverty.  Aside from the economic crisis, Indonesia has faced
            a series of natural disasters such as the 2004 tsunami which
            resulted in 160,000 deaths.</p>
