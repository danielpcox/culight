			<ul>
				<li>Thank God that the Brazilian missionary movement continues to grow and mature.</li>
				<li>Thank God for the increased growth of those who are seeking God as a result of economic uncertainty.  Evangelicals continue to grow in numbers and influence.</li>
				<li>Thank God that though he state of Goias was well known for spiritism, massive intercession by women is breaking this power.  In 1992, Evangelicals only made up 7% of the population and this number has drastically increased.</li>

		<span class="rightTitle">Keeping Brazil in Prayer</span>
		<span id="rightBlurb">
			<ul>
				<li>Brazil is the second-largest consumer of cocaine in the world.</li>
				<li>There has been a recent upsurge of drugs-related violence and weapons smuggling.</li>
				<li>The Catholic Church is in crisis. Only 13% are active in their commitment.  Brazil is actually the largest Catholic country, with 10% of the world’s Catholic population.  Pray that the Bible and its truths would mold the lives of these people, for while many profess Catholicism, many practice nominalism and spiritism.</li>
				<li>Brazil is also the largest spiritist country in the world. It appeals to the emotions and offers physical healing; both traits make it an attractive alternative to traditional Christianity. In 1975 there were at least 14,000 spiritist centres guided by 420,000 mediums. A majority of Brazilians are involved – most still claiming to be Christian. Pray both for Christians willing and spiritually equipped to minister to those bound by Satan, and for the deliverance of many.</li>

		<div id="blurb">
			<p>After being under Portuguese rule for over three hundred years, Brazil peacefully gained its independence in 1822. By far the largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's leading economic power and a regional leader. Highly unequal income distribution and crime remain pressing problems.</p>
