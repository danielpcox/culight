Over the past few years, the Christian community has participated in two
different events to help us understand and engage in world missions.  Abandoned
Devotion with SVM2 was a night of prayer for the nations, and CUStraightAhead
was a mobilization event, where we heard from guest speakers about how to go
and participate in missions.

Last year, we combined those two events into a brand new event called Light 09. We
gathered for an evening to LEARN about missions, PRAY for the nations, and
consider how we can SEND missionaries and even GO ourselves on missions.
This year will be the second annual LIGHT10.

The Details
The event will be on Saturday 1/30, 7:00pm, and the guest speaker will be Alex
Lee, Cornell '07.

The Website
LIGHT is more than a one-time event.  We've built a website, culight.org, where
you can learn about the event as well as how to PRAY for missionaries, SEND
missionaries, and GO on missions.  It is our hope that world missions becomes an
increasingly integral part of the Christian community at Cornell as we seek to
engage the world with the Gospel of Jesus.

The Name
We chose the name LIGHT as we meditated on John 1.  JESUS is the light, and we are not!  We live to POINT to him - not ourselves - as Savior and Treasure.  We do this at Cornell, and we go to do it in the workforce and the world.

    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 


    There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light. 


    The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world. 


    -John 1:1-9
