        <div class="text">
          Do you feel called to a profession and to overseas ministry? God may
          be calling you to be a Tentmaker. Merge your education, career, and
          ministry. Go. Live. Serve. is a sending agency committed to
          mobilizing, equipping and sending committed Christian students and
          professionals to serve and reach the unreached in the megacities of
          the 10/40 Window. Tentmakers are ambassadors for Christ,
          self-supporting like the apostle Paul, who made tents for a living.
          Tentmaking provides both work and ministry platforms. By doing a good
          job, tentmakers contribute to society and demonstrate how Christian
          values are lived out in the real world. By reaching out to their
          colleagues, they have natural connections with local people, who are
          part of their everyday lives. Professions can provide good entry
          points to places that do not welcome traditional missionaries.
